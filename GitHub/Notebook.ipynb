    "**How to Resolve a Merge Conflict:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Git will tell you `Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.`\n",

    "    For example, if the conflict was:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    <<<<<<< HEAD\n",

    "    =======\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    Email: updated.email@example.com\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4.  **Save the file.**\n",
    "5.  **Add the resolved file to the staging area:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add README.md\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "6.  **Commit the merge:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Merged add-contact-info into master and resolved conflicts\"\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "Sometimes you have files you *don't* want Git to track (e.g., temporary files, compiled code, credentials). A `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a file named `.gitignore` (yes, it starts with a dot) in the root of your repository.\n",

    "    # Ignore all .log files\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git restore <file_name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Install Git LFS**\n",
