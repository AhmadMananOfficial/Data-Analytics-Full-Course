    "\n",
    "      * Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions.\n",
    "      * Avoid monolithic scripts. Place common functions in separate `.py` files (e.g., in `src/`).\n",

    "6.  **Data Integrity and Immutability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Avoid modifying raw data. Create processed versions.\n",
    "      * Document all data cleaning and transformation steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "      * Write tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected.\n",

    "      * Use the `logging` module to record events, errors, and progress during long-running scripts.\n",
